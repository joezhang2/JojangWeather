Weather data is provided for free from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeatherMap</a> for daily
forecasts and <a href="https://www.apixu.com/">Apixu</a> for hourly forecasts. The weather icons are made by 
<a href="https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/">Erik Flowers</a>.

Potential things in the works (need to use this more to see if they are needed):
* Hovering over a weather condition provides a detailed description
* Highs and lows for forecasted temperature
* Enabling app to live in the menubar
